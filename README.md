Intelligent Environmental Monitoring System

This project monitors temperature, humidity, and harmful gas concentrations utilizing an ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller in combination with DHT11 and MQ135 sensors.
Periodically, the system gathers data, analyzes it to derive valuable insights, and saves it in a local XAMPP database. 
Through the analysis of this data, the system is able to determine when specific conditions are met, 
triggering a relay to control a fan and ensure optimal of air circulation. 
Furthermore, a web interface enables users to view trends, monitor readings, and switch between the relay's automatic and manual control modes. 
An LCD display also shows the sensor status in real time.
